# 💼 Send Money App — Flutter Fintech Build (Week 7)

> "Transactions don’t just move money — they move stories." — Leonard Phokane

A mobile-first payment feature built with Flutter, designed to deliver secure transactions, modular design, and ethical branding through NeoBrand Surge visuals.

## 🚀 Functional Highlights

- 🔽 `DropdownButtonWidget`: Select payment method (e.g. Bank Transfer, Mobile Wallet)
- 💡 Switch: Mark transaction as favorite
- ✅ Form validation: Empty fields + positive amount required
- 💳 `SendButton`: Reusable submission widget with branded styling
- 🌀 `AnimatedSuccess`: Confirmation overlay with auto-navigation
